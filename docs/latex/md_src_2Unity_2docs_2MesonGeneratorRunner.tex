One of the really nice things about using Unity with Ceedling is that Ceedling takes care of generating all of the test runners automatically. If you\textquotesingle{}re not using Ceedling though, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to do this yourself.

The way this is done in Unity is via a Ruby script called {\ttfamily generate\+\_\+test\+\_\+runner.\+rb}. When given a test file such as {\ttfamily test\+\_\+example.\+c}, the script will generate {\ttfamily test\+\_\+example\+\_\+\+Runner.\+c}, which provides the {\ttfamily main} method and some other useful plumbing.

So that you don\textquotesingle{}t have to run this by hand, a Meson generator is provided to generate the runner automatically for you. Generally with Meson, you would use Unity as a subproject and you\textquotesingle{}d want to access the generator from the parent.

For example, to get the generator you can use\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}unity_proj = subproject('unity')
runner_gen = unity_proj.get_variable('gen_test_runner')
\end{DoxyVerb}


Once you have the generator you need to pass it the absolute path of your test file. This seems to be a bug in how the paths work with subprojects in Meson. You can get the full path with {\ttfamily meson.\+source\+\_\+root()}, so you could do\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}test_runner = meson.source_root() / 'test/test_example.c'
\end{DoxyVerb}


You can then include {\ttfamily test\+\_\+runner} as a normal dependency to your builds. Meson will create the test runner in a private directory for each build target. It\textquotesingle{}s only meant to be used as part of the build, so if you need to refer to the runner after the build, you won\textquotesingle{}t be able to use the generator.
