\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This Framework is an optional add-\/on to Unity. By including \doxylink{unity__fixture_8h}{unity\+\_\+fixture.\+h} in place of \doxylink{unity_8h}{unity.\+h}, you may now work with Unity in a manner similar to Cpp\+UTest. This framework adds the concepts of test groups and gives finer control of your tests over the command line.

This framework is primarily supplied for those working through James Grenning\textquotesingle{}s book on Embedded Test Driven Development, or those coming to Unity from Cpp\+UTest. We should note that using this framework glosses over some of the features of Unity, and makes it more difficult to integrate with other testing tools like Ceedling and CMock.\hypertarget{readme.md_autotoc_md354}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Dependency Notification}{Dependency Notification}}\label{readme.md_autotoc_md354}
Fixtures, by default, uses the Memory addon as well. This is to make it simple for those trying to follow along with James\textquotesingle{} book. Using them together is completely optional. You may choose to use Fixtures without Memory handling by defining {\ttfamily UNITY\+\_\+\+FIXTURE\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+EXTRAS}. It will then stop automatically pulling in extras and leave you to do it as desired.\hypertarget{readme.md_autotoc_md355}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage information}{Usage information}}\label{readme.md_autotoc_md355}
By default the test executables produced by Unity Fixtures run all tests once, but the behavior can be configured with command-\/line flags. Run the test executable with the {\ttfamily -\/-\/help} flag for more information.

It\textquotesingle{}s possible to add a custom line at the end of the help message, typically to point to project-\/specific or company-\/specific unit test documentation. Define {\ttfamily UNITY\+\_\+\+CUSTOM\+\_\+\+HELP\+\_\+\+MSG} to provide a custom message, e.\+g.\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}#define UNITY_CUSTOM_HELP_MSG "If any test fails see https://example.com/troubleshooting"
\end{DoxyVerb}
